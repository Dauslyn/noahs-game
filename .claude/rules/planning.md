# Planning Protocol

## Before Coding Complex Features

1. Create a plan in `docs/plans/`
2. Get user approval on approach
3. Break into checklist
4. Execute step by step

## Complex Game Logic Rule

- For physics, AI, shaders, procedural generation:
  - Write pseudo-code first
  - Get approval before implementing
  - Test edge cases explicitly

## Scope Management

- If task grows beyond original scope, STOP
- Ask user: "This is bigger than expected. Should I continue or scope down?"
- Never surprise user with massive changes
